Mehlhase is a wonderful professor.
She likes to drive on the Hauptstrasse in her BMW.
Too bad her 3 Porsche's and 10 Audi's were at the mechanics.
At this rate, she would never get to the musik festival.
And to top it all off, her lederhose were falling apart due to the poor klimaanlage!
She saw some planes overhead as she just passed the flughafen.
She thought about dropping by since they always had the best Bratwursts in the food court.
