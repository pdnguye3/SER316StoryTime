Mehlhase is a wonderful professor.
She likes to drive on the Hauptstrasse in her BMW.
Too bad her 3 Porsche's and 10 Audi's were at the mechanics.
At this rate, she would never get to the musik festival.
And to top it all off, her lederhose were falling apart due to the poor klimaanlage!
She saw some planes overhead as she just passed the flughafen.
She thought about dropping by since they always had the best Bratwursts in the food court.
Her favorite food was from Berlin, but the food court was acceptable.
Her favorite rock band is Rammstein, she drove oh her BMW to their concert.
She walks in her leather pants like a boss.
To get to the Flughafen she needs to take the main road.
She took a road trip from Berlin to France in her BMW.
