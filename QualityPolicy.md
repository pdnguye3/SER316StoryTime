### Quality Policy
> Describe your Quality Policy in detail for this Sprint (remember what I ask you to do when I talk about the "In your Project" part in the lectures and what is mentioned after each assignment (in due course you will need to fill out all of them, check which ones are needed for each Deliverable). You should keep adding things to this file and adjusting your policy as you go.

**GitHub Workflow** (due Feb 2nd)
  > Structure: We will have a master branch which will always be ready to ship as a product. Before merging anything into the master, you have to do a pull request. We will have a dev branch which is our version we are working on and may break. We will have a branch for every user story and they will be named in the format "US#". We will have sub-branches for every task for the user stories named in the format "US#-T#". We will title our commit messages with the user story number and appropriate details and the content will contain what changes were made and what they do. At least 1 commit a day will be made by the team. Our pull requests to Master will always be fast-forwards and be reviewed by at least one team member in order to be approved. Each Sprint, our Git master will change and they will be responsible for merges into the Master branch. If the Git Master is not available, someone else can but must leave a comment in the pull request for it.
